node-channeladvisor
-------------------

This is a wrapper around the ChannelAdvisor SOAP API.

While it is pretty simple to use the `soap` module to make SOAP calls to
ChannelAdvisor, there is a lot of boilerplate for setting up each call which
this project aims to eliminate.

example
-------



install
-------

```bash
npm install node-channeladvisor-rest
```

api

The complete documentation of ChannelAdvisor's Rest API is available at the
[ChannelAdvisor Developer Network](http://developers.channeladvisor.com/rest/). 


notes
-----

I am not in any way affiliated with ChannelAdvisor other than being a customer.
ChannelAdvisor is a registered trademark of ChannelAdvisor Corporation. I have
used `channeladvisor` as the name of this module in good faith to help other
developers find obvious solutions.
