node-channeladvisor
-------------------

This is a wrapper around the ChannelAdvisor REST API.

While it is pretty simple to use the `Rest` module to make REST calls to
ChannelAdvisor, there is a lot of boilerplate for setting up each call which
this project aims to eliminate.

Example Usage
------------

//Coming Soon (for now look at test.js to get an idea)


Installing
----------

```bash
npm install node-channeladvisor-rest --save
```

Channel Advisor Offical API
---------------------------

The complete documentation of ChannelAdvisor's Rest API is available at the
[ChannelAdvisor Developer Network](http://developers.channeladvisor.com/rest/).
